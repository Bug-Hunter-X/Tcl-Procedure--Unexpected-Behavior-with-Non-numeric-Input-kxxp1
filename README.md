This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl procedures: unexpected behavior when dealing with non-numeric input. The `bug.tcl` file contains a flawed procedure that doesn't correctly handle such inputs. The `bugSolution.tcl` file provides a corrected version.  The bug arises from implicit type coercion in Tcl, which may not always produce the intended results.  This example highlights the importance of explicit type checking and handling in Tcl procedures to ensure robustness and avoid unexpected runtime errors.
